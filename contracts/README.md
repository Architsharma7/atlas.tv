## STREAM SPLIT FLOW

- Superfluid Streams will be started during the subscriptions to Atlas Router
- Every 24Hour , we refresh the Subscription data , checking the total views & watch hours on the platform , along with metrics for each and every creator
- The Stats will be stored in polybase repo to maintain the final stats to be setup in the Contract
- Gelato Functions is used to call this off chain database for getting the data
- Depending on that , a new stream will be started out of the Atlas Router to the creator , allowing them to earn in realtime
- The Stream will be distributed to all on the basis of the the viewership , using IDA in the backend
